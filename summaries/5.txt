# Concurrency Primitives

## Concurrency in BEAM

In Beam, the unit of concurrency is a process.

!!! Note: check the difference between BEAM process and OS process.

- Process helps to run things in parallel(scalability)
- Process ensures isolation(faulty tolerance)

## Creating a process

Use spawn/1 to create a process. spawn/1 takes a zero-arity lambda function that will run in the new process. spawn/1 is immediately returned after the process is created.

spawn/1 returns a pid, which is the process identifier. pid can be used to communicate with the process.

The provided lambda is executed in the new process and therefore runs concurrently. After the lambda is done, the spawned process exits, and its memory is released.
