# Generic Server Processes


## Building a generic server process
- All code that implements a server process needs to do the following:
  - Spawn a separate process
  -	Run an infinite loop in the process
  -	Maintain the process state
  -	React to messages
  -	Send a response back to the caller

### Plugging in with modules
- There should be a generic code that drives the entire process.
- The generic code will accept a module as argument(callback module). This module is the implementation code.
- This module will define a set of functions that can be invoked by the generic code.
